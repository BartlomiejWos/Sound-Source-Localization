# Microphone Array Speech Source Localization using SRP-PHAT and MUSIC

## The purpose of this project was to implement sound source direction estimation algorithm using Raspberry PI microphone array.

Parts of the project shows how do the following: 
* VAD - Voice Activity Detector
* LPC - Linear Predicting Coding (envelope spectrum analysis and detection of main frequencies)
* MUSIC - Multiple Signal Classification algorithm for signal direction finding 
* SRP-PHAT - Steered-response power with phase transform algorithm for signal direction finding
